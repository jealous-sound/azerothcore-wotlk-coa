-- Majordomo Executus (12018) carries lootid = 0 on every difficulty: Unit::Kill's
-- "if (uint32 lootid = creature->GetCreatureTemplate()->lootid) loot->FillLoot(...)" skips him
-- entirely on death, so FlexItems.cpp's MISCHOOK_ON_AFTER_LOOT_TEMPLATE_PROCESS hook (added by
-- rev_20261001_70, meant to give him a random-item roll from the common pool, §7.3) never fires -
-- confirmed live: a GM kill never opens a loot window for him at all. This is unrelated to §7.2's
-- Cache of the Firelord gameobject (his real, intended loot source, still untouched) and to §7.1's
-- guaranteed-token mechanism (he was never part of it). Self-referencing lootid is this core's
-- standard idiom for "this creature has a (possibly empty) creature_loot_template row".
--
-- A non-zero lootid alone is not enough: Loot::FillLoot looks the id up via
-- LootStore::GetLootFor(lootId), which only returns a LootTemplate for ids LootMgr actually loaded
-- from creature_loot_template - with none, FillLoot bails out before ever calling
-- LootTemplate::Process or ScriptMgr::OnAfterLootTemplateProcess, so the hook still never fires.
-- confirmed live (second round): the lootid alone did not open a loot window either. A single
-- Chance = 0, GroupId = 0 row (this fork's own existing idiom for "never rolls under this core's
-- rules", e.g. the pre-existing Stoneclad Libram/Tome of Burning Passion Normal rows, §7) gives
-- every difficulty a real LootTemplate object without ever adding a guaranteed drop of its own;
-- Rune of Descension (375250) is reused rather than inventing a new filler item, since it is
-- already a guaranteed row on every other scheduled boss's own table.
