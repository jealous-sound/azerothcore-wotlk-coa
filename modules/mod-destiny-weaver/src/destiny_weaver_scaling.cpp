// Open World Scaling, per character.
//
// A creature carries one level, one pool and one set of stats, in one object, handed to every
// client - so the obvious implementation (raise the creature to the player's level) necessarily
// hands that player's scaling to everyone else standing in the same zone. That is not what this
// does, and not what the live service did.
//
// What a client is told is not the object. Every values update is built per recipient
// (`Map::SendObjectUpdates` groups a packet per player, `Unit::PatchValuesUpdate` exists to rewrite
// fields for one target, and the core exposes both as `ShouldTrackValuesUpdatePosByIndex` +
// `OnPatchValuesUpdate`). So the creature keeps its authored level and stats, untouched for
// everyone, and a character who asked for scaling is shown *their* version of it.
//
// That version is built from the same table a creature is built from. `creature_classlevelstats` is
// one row per (level, class) holding health, mana, armor, attack power and weapon damage - exactly
// what `Creature::SelectLevel()` reads and `UpdateAllStats()` writes into the fields the client and
// the fight both use. A view is the row at the viewer's level, so every one of those scales:
//
//   level      the curve's answer for that character (their level - offset), sent to them alone
//   health     the row's health at that level; the bar they see, and the pool their fight is paced by
//   mana       the row's mana, likewise
//   armor      the row's armor, which is what their blows are mitigated by (the core asks this
//              module for it in Unit::CalcArmorReducedDamage - the one place the viewer is not
//              visible from the fields)
//   damage     the row's weapon damage plus the attack power behind it, which is what the creature
//              hits *them* for, and what they hit *it* for
//   skills     the skill values the hit/crit/dodge/parry roll uses, at that level
//
// The pool is shared, which is the one thing a view cannot change: one wolf has one pool of hit
// points and two characters may be hitting it, each shown a pool scaled to their own version. So
// what a character's damage takes out of the real pool is scaled by the same ratio that maps the
// real pool onto the one they are shown (DamageDealtToPool): their bar falls by exactly the number
// their client is told, and the fight lasts what a fight at their version's level lasts. Coming the
// other way, what the creature deals them is scaled to what its version hits for
// (DamageTakenFactor). Both factors are 1 for a character with scaling off, and for a character
// whose version *is* the creature: their fight is then the authored fight, and nobody else's fight
// changes because of it.
