// Destiny Weaver: the leveling-experience NPC.
//
// The live realm fronted two per-character choices with ten "Destiny Weaver" creatures - five
// models, two names each - and this realm has neither the creatures nor the choices. What is
// restored here is the menu and the two settings behind it; the creatures and their gossip text
// are in the module's SQL revision.
//
//   * Open World Scaling        - the quest levels this character reads and plays at. Creatures in
//                                 the open world are scaled realm-wide by mod-ascension-compat
//                                 (AscensionCompat.LevelScaling), because a creature carries one
//                                 level that the server broadcasts to every client: it cannot be
//                                 level 27 for one character and level 2 for the one beside them.
//                                 A quest level, unlike a creature level, is sent to a single
//                                 client, so it can genuinely follow this character's choice.
//   * Experience Bonus Control  - the bonus experience sources (potions, auras, recruit-a-friend)
//                                 stop paying, so the character progresses at the base rate; the
//                                 stripping itself is in destiny_weaver_xp.cpp.
//
// Both are stored per character. A character that never chose scaling follows the realm default,
// which is how the realm behaves today; Experience Bonus Control is opt-in.
//
// The menu is the live realm's, taken from a screenshot of the original gossip: the greeting is
// npc_text 30520 and the two options read
//
//   Experience bonuses! <state>      (experience first, then scaling)
//   Open world scaling! <state>
//
// with <state> green while the choice is on and red while it is off. Each option paints its own
// icon through an inline texture escape in the option text rather than the option's icon byte:
//
//   |TInterface/ICONS/<name>:40:40:-22:0|t|r<label>
//
// 40x40, pulled 22px left so it hangs over the row's left edge. That is how an Ascension menu
// carries these icons - an archive observation of a live menu (npc 6740, the Stormwind innkeeper)
// records the same shape with inv_misc_rune_01 and inv_misc_bag_10 - and it is the only way to
// reach art outside the client's own gossip icon set. Both icons were confirmed in game against the
// captured screenshot: the scaling one is nhi_corruptionpower and the experience one is
// nhi_infernaltome, the burning tome. Nothing else in the menu deviates from the capture, including
// the absence of a third option.
