// Experience Bonus Control: the character asked to progress at the base rate.
//
// The bonus sources the live NPC named - Potions of Experience, Auras of Experience and the
// recruit-a-friend bonus - are all paid out through Player::GiveXP, but two of them are folded
// into the amount *before* any script sees it:
//
//   * creature kills: KillRewarder::_RewardPlayer applies SPELL_AURA_MOD_XP_PCT (the potions and
//                     the party Aura of Experience, spell 818059) and then calls the
//                     PLAYERHOOK_ON_GIVE_EXP hook;
//   * quests:         Player::CalculateQuestRewardXP applies SPELL_AURA_MOD_XP_QUEST_PCT, and
//                     Player::RewardQuest calls the same hook.
//
// So the hook divides those multipliers straight back out, which leaves the base award the realm
// rates produced - the realm's own XP rate and our dynamic-XP presets are untouched, because
// neither of them is one of the sources being disabled. Only the *positive* side is taken out:
// this realm also carries aura 200/291 effects that are drawbacks (+0% and negative amounts, such
// as XP Lock, Callowness or a challenge's own penalty), and a character who switches the bonuses
// off should still feel those.
//
// The recruit-a-friend bonus works the other way round: Player::GiveXP adds it after the hook
// (bonus_xp = 2 * xp), so when the character is eligible the hook hands over a third of the
// base and the payout lands on the base amount.
//
// A character whose flag is off is not touched at all: the hook returns before reading anything.
