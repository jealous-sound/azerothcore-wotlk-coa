/*
 * mod-book-of-artisans - the profession trainer books of the realm and the window they open.
 *
 * CoA's books are props a player right-clicks: the Book of Artisans teaches every profession,
 * every rank and every recipe, the Beginner's Book of Artisans the apprentice tier in the
 * starting zones. Both are ordinary core trainers - `creature_default_trainer` points the
 * creature at a `trainer` row and `trainer_spell` carries the list - so the window is the
 * core's own (`WorldSession::SendTrainerList` -> `Trainer::SendSpells`) and this module never
 * builds one. That is deliberate: `Trainer::GetSpellState` is the single function that both
 * writes a row's state and gates the purchase of it, so a row can never read as available in
 * the window and then be refused, or read as known and still be sold. A window built anywhere
 * else would be a second opinion about the same character.
 *
 * What the data cannot say either is which rows a player has any business seeing. The books carry
 * every rank of every profession at once, and the client draws every rank out of reach as a red row
 * nobody can buy: a character who has never held a needle gets shown Grand Master Tailoring, and
 * there is nothing to do about it from there. So the books ask for the trainable rows
 * (`SendTrainerList`'s `onlyTrainable`, a plain argument to `Trainer::SendSpells`): the entry rank
 * of each profession, the ranks they have reached, and the ranks they already know, drawn greyed.
 * Train the apprentice rank, put the skill to 50, and journeyman is in the next window sent.
 *
 * What the module adds is the two things data cannot express:
 *
 *   * the page's first option. A right click is answered with the page the SQL defines - "I
 *     require training!" and "I would like to browse your goods." - and the core is what
 *     sends it, so the module only takes over the training option: that is what keeps the
 *     window it opens the filtered one. The second option opens the vendor list, which is the
 *     core's own business, and the list of goods is data (`npc_vendor`);
 *   * the window is a snapshot of the character at the moment it was sent, so a purchase from
 *     the book is followed by a fresh list. Learning a profession, buying a rank and learning a
 *     recipe all change what the book offers - the rows behind them, the rows they made
 *     available - and without that second list the client would keep showing the state from
 *     before the purchase until the book was closed and reopened.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* done here: pushing a new list when a profession skill goes up elsewhere
 * (crafting, mainly). A trainer window in 3.3.5 is a snapshot the player reopens, pushing one
 * on every skill-up would send a 169 KB list behind a window that may well be closed, and the
 * client cannot tell the server that it closed the frame.
 *
 * The other half of the restoration is data, and it is in the SQL next door: the page, its two
 * options, the text it shows and the shelves behind the second option. `npcflag` 177 (gossip |
 * trainer | class trainer | vendor) is what makes the client ask for that page and then accept
 * both frames the page's options lead to. The startup check at the end of this file reports any
 * half of that chain that goes missing.
 *
 * The creature script is attached by the world SQL in data/sql/db-world/book_of_artisans.sql,
 * which also restores both creatures, their display and their spawns. That SQL is applied by
 * the core's own module updater, so the module and the data stay together.
