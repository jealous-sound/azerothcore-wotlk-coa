/*
 * Sacrificial Chains (92030), Majordomo Executus's periodic hostage add.
 *
 * Correction (this session, raw WoWCombatLog re-query - mc-dataset.json's own aggregation drops
 * aura target names, so this reads the four logs directly:
 * local/logs/ascension/logs-rar/2026-08-25-14.41.47, -19.31.05, -23.06.25, -27-18.49.53 in the
 * coa-combatlog-parser checkout). The previous implementation had 92030 self-cast Sacrifice and
 * loop a heal-to-full/re-sacrifice on itself. That is not what happens:
 *
 *   - 2108020 Sacrifice's own Spell.dbc row targets TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ENEMY, not the caster.
 *     Every logged SPELL_AURA_APPLIED for 2108020 has "Sacrificial Chains" as the *source* and a
 *     player as the *dest* (e.g. "..., 0xF13001677E00317C, Sacrificial Chains, ..., 0x...C569,
 *     Paredinha, ..., 2108020, Sacrifice, ..., DEBUFF"). The chain casts Sacrifice on players, not
 *     itself - this is the "chains a player" mechanic the restoration was missing.
 *   - Each spawn casts 2108023 Sacrifice rank 2 (a SPELL_EFFECT_HEAL_MAX_HEALTH, "restores the
 *     target health to full, then sacrifices it") on the same target a few hundred ms *before*
 *     2108020, once, at spawn - not a repeating loop. No repeat cast of 2108023 or 2108020 was
 *     ever observed for the same chain instance in any of the four logs.
 *   - One spawn (one creature GUID) chains more than one player at once: every apply for a given
 *     GUID lands within ~0.5s of the others, e.g. GUID …E003357 (Ascended, 12p,
 *     2026-08-25-14.41.47) applies to both "Scorchwalker" and "Geonox" 0.5s apart. Counting
 *     distinct targets per GUID across all four logs, re-verified at the coordinator's request
 *     (exact per-spawn group sizes, not just a max): Heroic (13p, 1 pull, 6 spawns) is 2 targets
 *     every single time (6/6) - never 3, contrary to the "3 on Normal/Heroic" fallback the task
 *     otherwise allows. Ascended (12p x2 pulls + 15p x1 pull, 35 spawns total) is 1 target 14/35
 *     of the time and 2 targets the other 21/35 - never 3 or 4. Mythic (17p, 1 pull, 8 spawns) is
 *     2 targets 6/8 of the time and 3 targets the other 2/8 - the only difficulty that ever reaches
 *     3. No Normal Majordomo pull exists in the corpus.
 *
 *     Rule set by the user from CoA play: chained players follow the flex raid size, not
 *     difficulty - same on every mode. The flex-scaled player count (coa_flex::CountPlayers,
 *     non-GM players in the instance, clamped 10..25) maps to a cap of 1 at 10-14 players, 2 at
 *     15-19, 3 at 20-25 (so also 1 below 10, the clamp's floor); a random distinct selection of
 *     nearby raid members is chained, clamped to however many are actually available.
 *   - Killing the chain frees its chained player(s): in every clean (non-wipe) sample, e.g. GUID
 *     …E00317C, the chain's own UNIT_DIED/PARTY_KILL and the SPELL_AURA_REMOVED of 2108020 on its
 *     target(s) share the exact same log timestamp (17:43:57.250 for all three lines). 2108020's
 *     own SpellDuration (index 5) is 300000ms - far longer than the 10-24s the chain actually
 *     lived - so this is not the debuff's own timer expiring; the removal is tied to the chain's
 *     death. JustDied here explicitly clears Sacrifice from every player it chained.
 *   - Berserk (2100213) is real but rare (1/56 Sacrifice applications, one Ascended pull) and, in
 *     that one case, cast at spawn alongside the Sacrifice applies (not after some elapsed
 *     "loops"; there is no loop to count). Kept as a small chance at spawn, matching the measured
 *     rarity, self-only (TARGET_UNIT_CASTER on all three effects per Spell.dbc) and with no other
 *     behavioural effect on this passive, non-melee add.
 *   - Not implemented: a "roast" that kills an unfreed chain's captives. 2108020 has no
 *     EffectTriggerSpell and no SPELL_PERIODIC_DAMAGE tied to spell id 2108020 appears anywhere
 *     in the four logs. The one Berserk sample's two chained players (Scorchwalker, Froez) did
 *     both die ~38-48s after being chained without the chain itself dying first - but nothing in
 *     Spell.dbc or the log attributes that death to 2108020 specifically (2108020's own
 *     SPELL_AURA_MOD_DAMAGE_PERCENT_TAKEN effect is -101, i.e. ~immune to ordinary damage from
 *     "outside sources"), so a timed kill on unfreed captives would be invented, not evidenced.
 *     Flagged, not built.
 *
 * Timing (same re-query, by pull id): each instance's own lifetime before dying to raid damage
 * clusters at 10-24s (median ~15s) across every difficulty and player count sampled; the boss
 * summons a new one on a median ~47-50s cycle starting a median 29s after the pull (both
 * measured, see boss_majordomo_executus.cpp - unchanged by this correction).
 *
 * Corrected (diag-G3.md "Ascension evidence" #2): two independently-checked chained players show
 * a hard stop on every cast/ability for essentially the exact Sacrifice debuff duration (22.7s
 * and 18.3s gaps bounding ~20.3s/~17.1s chain lifetimes) - not just "fewer casts". Neither
 * 2108020 nor 2108023 carries any mechanic/aura in Spell.dbc that would do this, so the evidence
 * chain cannot see the real mechanism from a combat log alone. Per the user's own decision,
 * spell_sacrificial_chains_sacrifice_coa (below) reproduces the effect server-side: on apply, the
 * chained player is moved next to the chain and loses movement/casting/melee until the debuff is
 * removed; on remove, all three are restored. Also corrected: the chain itself now spawns at a
 * fixed point (Majordomo's own battle position, boss_majordomo_executus.cpp) instead of under a
 * random player, so "next to the chain" is a stable spot, not wherever a random target stood.
 *
 * Type 10 in the export ("non-combat/object-like") is real DBC data, unlike this row's
 * placeholder level/health/faction (hp-pools.md) - implemented passive, no melee: the raid
 * burns it down, it does not fight back.
